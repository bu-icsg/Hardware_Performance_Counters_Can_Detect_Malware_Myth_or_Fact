// YUNI's default license is the GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL), with some
// exclusions (see below). This basically means that you can get the full source
// code for nothing, so long as you adhere to a few rules.

// Under the LGPL you may use YUNI for any purpose you wish, and modify it if you
// require, as long as you:
// 
// Pass on the (modified) YUNI source code with your software, with original 
// copyrights intact :
//  * If you distribute electronically, the source can be a separate download
//    (either from your own site if you modified YUNI, or to the official YUNI
//    website if you used an unmodified version) â€“ just include a link in your
//    documentation
//  * If you distribute physical media, the YUNI source that you used to build
//    your application should be included on that media
// Make it clear where you have customised it.
// 
// In addition to the LGPL license text, the following exceptions / clarifications
// to the LGPL conditions apply to YUNI:
// 
//  * Making modifications to YUNI configuration files, build scripts and
//    configuration headers such as yuni/platform.h in order to create a
//    customised build setup of YUNI with the otherwise unmodified source code,
//    does not constitute a derived work
//  * Building against YUNI headers which have inlined code does not constitute a
//    derived work
//  * Code which subclasses YUNI classes outside of the YUNI libraries does not
//    form a derived work
//  * Statically linking the YUNI libraries into a user application does not make
//    the user application a derived work.
//  * Using source code obsfucation on the YUNI source code when distributing it
//    is not permitted.
// As per the terms of the LGPL, a "derived work" is one for which you have to
// distribute source code for, so when the clauses above define something as not
// a derived work, it means you don't have to distribute source code for it.
// However, the original YUNI source code with all modifications must always be
// made available.
